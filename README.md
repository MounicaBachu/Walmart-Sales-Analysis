# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
Visualization helps to understand the results of data analysis quickly and concisely in the entire process of collecting, cleaning and analyzing data. 

Starting with Tableau installation, our project describes the process of understanding and visualizing Walmart sales data.

The aim of this project is to load, transform and analyze the Walmart sales data by creating an interactive dashboard on tableau which provides insights on yearly sales, monthly sales, weekly sales, department wise sales of Walmart stores. This helps to give cognizance on overall performance of the stores. This can help management on decision making to improve their sales.

Insights:
● When we observed the pattern of sales between
holiday weeks and non holiday weeks, we found
that average weekly sales during thanksgiving and
christmas were higher than the average weekly
sales, the same can be observed from the average
sales container in the dashboard.
● Being the only year with a complete data of all
months, Walmart sales of 2011 reports more sales
than 2010 and 2012. Within the sales, December
month shows the highest sales among all months.
● During the analysis, Type A stores i.e super centres
performed better than B and C.
● We cannot establish weekly sales to be in linear
relationship with temperature, but higher sales
were observed in the regions with temperature
between 70 and 80 Fahrenheit.
● Based on cumulative sales, we observed that store
20 reported highest sales and 33 reported the
minimum sales among all 45 stores.
● Based on the store wise analysis of variance, store
14 showed maximum variance compared to others
and store 5 showed the least variance, we can say
that store5 5 sales were more static in pattern.
● Type A stores were larger in size and type C stores
were smaller compared to other two types of stores.
● November and December data for 2012 was not
given, so quarter four sales of 2012 is inaccurate.
● Department number 92 i.e. grocery department
which is used by everyone irrespective of the
seasons, showed the maximum sales and
department 43 showed the minimum sales
compared to other 98 departments.
