# Walmart-Sales-Analysis
Visualization helps to understand the results of data analysis quickly and concisely in the entire process of collecting, cleaning and analyzing data. 
Starting with Tableau installation, our project describes the process of understanding and visualizing Walmart sales data. The aim of our project is to load, transform and analyze the Walmart sales data by creating an interactive dashboard on tableau which provides insights on yearly sales, monthly sales, weekly sales, department wise sales of Walmart stores. This helps to give cognizance on overall performance of the stores. This can help management on decision making to improve their sales.
